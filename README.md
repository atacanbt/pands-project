# Programming and Scripting Module Project


## About the Repository

This repository contains my analysis on the well-known Fisher's Iris Dataset. This is the final project for the Programming and Scripting module of the Data Analytics course at Atlantic Technological University for the academic year 2023-2024

For details of the analysis and walk through, please see the **my_analysis.ipynb** notebook in the repository.

## About the Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the fields of data science and machine learning, containing 150 samples of iris flowers evenly distributed among three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has five attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width—all measured in centimeters—and the species. Introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, it serves as an excellent introductory dataset for data visualization and machine learning due to its simplicity and small size.

## Get Started
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebook. Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed;

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Clone the repository. Cloning [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
    - For Python script:
        1. In Terminal, set the directory to your repository.
        2. Run the script using following command; "python **script.py**"
        (Replace **script.py** with the name of the Python script you want to run.)
    - For Jupyter notebook:
        1. Run the notebook in Visual Studio Code
        2. Alternatively, you can run the notebook on web page through Google Colab by clicking to the badge above.
